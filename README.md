## 🛠️ Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (3.19+)
- Dart SDK (3.3+)
- A Supabase account (free tier available)
- Git

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Khesir/KeepTrack.git
cd KeepTrack
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 3. Set up Supabase

#### Create a Supabase project

1. Go to [https://supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Create a new project
3. Wait for the project to be ready

#### Run the bootstrap script

This is a **ONE-TIME** setup that enables automatic migrations:

1. Open your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor** in the sidebar
3. Click **New Query**
4. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase/bootstrap.sql`
5. Click **Run** (or press Cmd/Ctrl + Enter)

The bootstrap script creates:
- The `exec_sql` function (allows automatic migrations)
- The `schema_migrations` table (tracks applied migrations)

### 4. Configure your app

Update `lib/main.dart` with your Supabase credentials:

```dart
await Supabase.initialize(
  url: 'YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL',
  anonKey: 'YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY',
);
```

Find these values in your Supabase project settings under **API**.

### 5. Run the app

```bash
# Desktop
flutter run -d windows  # or macos, linux

# Mobile
flutter run -d android  # or ios
```

The app will automatically:
1. Connect to Supabase
2. Run all pending migrations
3. Set up the database schema
4. Start the app

## 🗄️ Database Migrations

Keep Track uses **automatic database migrations**. When you start the app:

1. Migration manager checks which migrations have been applied
2. Pending migrations are executed automatically via the `exec_sql` RPC function
3. Successful migrations are recorded in the `schema_migrations` table

No manual SQL execution needed after the initial bootstrap!

See [Migration System Guide](lib/core/migrations/README.md) for more details.

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Clean Architecture** with separation of concerns
- **Custom Dependency Injection** system
- **Custom State Management** using `StreamState`
- **Feature-based organization** for scalability
- **Repository pattern** for data access
- **Automatic migrations** for database schema updates
